Numerous studies suggest that the current popular designs of coronary stents are functionally equivalent and suffer a 16 to 22 percent rate of restenosis. Although the use of coronary stents is growing, the benefits of their use remain controversial in certain clinical situations or indications due to their potential complications. The application of gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) surface modification such as smoothing or cleaning appears to reduce these complications and lead to genuine cost savings and an improvement in patient quality of life. The present invention is directed to the use of GCIB surface modification to overcome prior problems of thrombosis and restenosis.

A multilayer balloon catheter is formed to have an inner layer and an outer layer, where the outer layer is adapted to resist shredding and premature rupture. The outer layer is formed of a material having a glass transition temperature that is lower than the transition or melting temperature of the inner layer. By forming the balloon on a mold at a temperature between the glass transition temperature of the outer layer and the glass transition or melting temperature of the inner layer, the outer layer will undergo a thermal relaxation that will alleviate some of the axial orientation of the polymer chains that develop during the formation of the multilayer balloon. This relaxation leads to a resistance to shredding when the balloon is expanded during operation.",1

The vibrometer is sensitive to motion of the skin surface in a direction parallel to the laser beam and produces a signal representative of this motion. By plotting the velocity of the skin surface movement in the direction parallel to the laser beam with respect to time, a waveform is produced that has been found to be representative of the blood pressure waveform and highly defined to thereby permit accurate timing analysis thereof relating to cardiac",0

Multiple strands of a resilient metal or plastic are braided to form a tubular configuration of a predetermined outside diameter which assumes a lesser diameter when the tubular stent is longitudinally stretched. When in its stretched condition, it is coated with a polymeric material which is then cross-linked to effectively ""freeze"" the intersections of the braided structure holding it in its reduced diameter configuration. The tubular stent is designed to be placed within a body vessel using a balloon stent delivery catheter. When the balloon surrounded by the braided wire stent is inflated, the stent expands initially to an extent to break the bonds of plastic material between the intersections of the strands, thereby permitting self-expansion to take place. The coating may also comprise a hydrogel or an elastomeric impregnated with the water soluble ",0

The landing zone is installed by wrapping a landing band around a portion of a vessel. The landing band may be selected to be fixed at a diameter so that it inhibits any expansion of the vessel, and also supports a later-installed TAVR or TEVAR device. The TAVR or TEVAR device is then endovascularly delivered to the vessel and deployed therein. The device expands until it contacts the vessel, which is supported from the outside by the landing band, which thus constrains and supports the device from outside.",0

A medical device applies localized heat to a site in a patient's body by irradiation with light and by conduction. The device includes a radiant energy transmitting conduit, typically an optic fiber, that carries radiant energy, typically high intensity light such as laser, into a body cavity, typically the uterus, from an energy source, typically a laser source, that is located exterior to the body. At the operative head of the device within the body cavity a portion of the transmitted radiant energy is absorbed and converted to heat. This heat is radiated or conducted from the device head substantially omnidirectionally in order to aid in destruction of tissue. Meanwhile, another portion of the transmitted radiant energy is emitted through an aperture in the device head as light energy suitable for more localized and intense heating and destruction of tissue or other organic matter.

This deployment device has a malleable implant disposed around the balloon, which is disposed around a guide catheter. The balloon is inflated and expands the malleable implant. The malleable implant retains the expanded shape and urges the Eustachian tube toward a closed state.",0
